## Quora_Question_Classification

## Objective:
The Quora Sincere/Insincere Questions Classification is a Python NLP project that aims to 
segregate the given dataset of questions posted on Quora into relevant Sincere or Insincere buckets 
for optimized text classification.

### Sincere Questions: 
These are questions that are genuinely seeking helpful answers, contributing to 
the knowledge-sharing ethos of Quora. Sincere questions are founded on a desire for information, 
insights, and solutions.

### Insincere Questions: 
Insincere questions are problematic as they are typically not genuine inquiries 
for information. They may be based on false premises, intended to make statements, or can be 
offensive, divisive, or inappropriate in nature. These questions often violate Quora's "Be Nice, Be 
Respectful" policy
